# Preloop Architecture

Preloop is an open-source, responsible AI automation platform. It can proxy tools from MCP servers, optionally adding a human approval layer with configurable policies. It provides event-driven agentic flows to intelligently automate common tasks using agent frameworks like Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Aider or OpenHands. It integrates with issue & code tracking systems like Jira, GitHub, GitLab, both for listening to events and for ingesting issues, comments, documentation and code. By leveraging vector-based similarity search, Preloop detects duplicate and overlapping issues, detects unmapped dependencies, evaluates compliance metrics, and offers intelligent suggestions to streamline workflows. The architecture now also includes Preloop-owned model-gateway surfaces so managed runtimes can route model traffic through a central enforcement point for telemetry, budgets, session observability, and secret custody. The architecture emphasizes flexibility, performance, and ease of integration, providing access via a REST API, a web UI, and an MCP server for various clients.

ARCHITECTURE.md is the map. Read one chapter under `docs/architecture/` for the subsystem you are changing. Do not load every chapter for context.

Implementation PRs can use [durable feedback subscriptions](docs/guide/flows/durable-implementation-feedback.md): PostgreSQL threads and inbox leases coordinate new execution turns, while native conversation artifacts remain isolated from workspace checkpoints. Repository events and bounded reconciliation advance CI/review gates without idle agent containers.
